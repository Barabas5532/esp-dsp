# ESP-DSP Examples

This directory contains a range of example ESP-DSP projects. 
These examples are intended to demonstrate part of ESP-DSP functionality (e.g. initialization, execution) and to provide code that you can copy and adapt into your own projects.

See the [README.md](../README.md) file in the upper level directory for more information about ESP-DSP.
